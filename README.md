This repository contain source files for fabricating the environmental sensors developed by Akvo in partnership with SODAQ and REGGS. The files are stored in two folders:

*hardware-packaging*: contains design files for the plastic and aluminum components, as well as photography, stickers, and packaging.

The abbreviations stand for:

* WEC: Water EC sensor
* SEC: Soil EC sensor
* SOM: Soil Moisture sensor
* SUM: Stove Usage Monitoring sensor
* WAP: Water pressure sensor
* HAP: House Air Pollution sensor
* SSU: Standard Surface Unit

*pcb-software-manuals*: contains design files for the PCB's, including manuals, firmware and supporting software.

Each device folder includes:

Hardware files : Eagle CAD files for the schematic and gerbers, including a bill of materials (BOM).

Software files : arduino files and associated libraries

Manual : in pdf & markdown format
